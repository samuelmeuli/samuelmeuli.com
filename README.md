This is the source code of my personal website, [samuelmeuli.com](https://samuelmeuli.com). The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and Sass.

## Development

Make sure you have Hugo installed (`brew install hugo`). Node.js and Yarn are also required for linting and asset minification.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone REPO_URL`
2. Install all dependencies: `yarn`
3. Start Hugo's development server: `yarn start`
4. View the site on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
